Essential fatty acids are incorporated into every cell membrane in the body, in the form of compounds called phospholipids. Cell membranes play the vital role of regulating what goes into, and what comes out of, each cell. The integrity and fluidity of the cell membrane is determined by the type of phospholipid that is available for the body to use. Cell membranes made up mainly of phospholipids derived from the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids are more fluid and function better than cell membranes made up of saturated fat or trans-fatty acids. A cell membrane working at optimal levels retains vital nutrients and electrolytes, has the ability to communicate with other cells and is responsive to hormones.Omega-3 fatty acids are also important components of substances known as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are important in immune function, smooth muscle function, platelet aggregation and inflammation. Fish oils contain prostaglandins and leukotrienes from omega-3 fatty acids have less inflammatory activity than prostaglandins and leukotrienes derived from other types of fatty acids.Fish oil inhibits triglyceride synthesis in the liver, therefore supporting a healthy cardiovascular system","UCT DETAILSHideDescriptionPolysorbate 80 is an artificial chemical that's used in shampoos, cosmetics and some foods as an emulsifier.

It is incorporated into the cell membranes and helps maintain their integrity throughout the body.As an antioxidant vitamin E acts as a 'free-radical scavenger'. Free radicals are common in the body, arising through a variety of mechanisms. Some are generated in the body as part of normal energy-producing processes, some are generated by pollutants such as air pollution, and some are generated by lifestyle factors such as excess dietary fats, cigarette smoke, and alcohol ingestion. Many of these free radicals are dealt with by the body's own antioxidant defences. Some free radicals escape these defences, and tend to accumulate. Research suggests that this accumulation of free radicals can result in cellular damage.Vitamin E helps maintain heart health as it can help to protect artery walls from free radical damage. A damaged artery wall is more susceptible to developing plaques, which are raised patches on the normally thin and elastic inner wall of the artery. These plaques are composed of a number of substances which include oxidized LDL-cholesterol. Large plaques in arteries can end up obstructing blood circulation.Vitamin E helps protect fat and cholesterol, particularly LDL-cholesterol, from oxidation. Fats and cholesterol are very susceptible to free radical damage, which leads to the formation of a toxic derivative called oxidized LDL-cholesterol. It is currently understood that LDL-cholesterol is only harmful to the body after it has become oxidized.; Product Usage; Adults - Take 1 capsule daily with a meal.
